   <h1>Order to Disorder in Quasiperiodic Systems</h1>
   <p> My thesis's centerpiece will be the discovery that quasiperiodic microstructure can lead to bulk transport properties similar to random systems. This is despite quasiperiodic microgeometry that is entirely deterministic. <p>
   <p> This research was inspired by the surprising material properties of metallic quasicrystals. Aluminum alloys quasicrystals can be hard, brittle, and poorly conducting, while similar alloys are ductile and conductive.<p>
   <p> Below is a recording of my short presentation on this topic for the 2020 APS four corners section meeting: <p>
