   <h1>My thirty-second biography:</h1>
    <br><br>
   <p>I grew up in Kirkland, Washington, and went to UC Berkeley for physics as an undergraduate.
      After college, I worked in the Applied Physics Lab at the University of Washington.
      About six years ago, I moved to Salt Lake City, started a family, and entered the University of Utah's physics program.</p>
   <p>I've been a climber for 27 years, and I've done big walls and hard sport climbs.
      I've been passionate about paragliding in the past, but graduate school and parenting have kept me pretty busy recently.
      Recent sci-fi books that I've enjoyed are the "Red Rising" series by Pierce Brown.</p>
   <p>Below is a picture of my beautiful wife (Attaya), son (Noble), and myself.
      We're alternately looking tough vs. happy.
      And, in the third picture, I am performing an interpretive dance which I call "Debugging Code".</p>
