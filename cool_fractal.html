   <p> To study transport in quasiperiodic systems, we came up with moir√© pattern derived microgeometry. Twist angle and a scale factor parameterize the "microgeometry space". While finite computational resources constrain us, we want to represent truly aperiodic systems. Consequently, we mapped out periodic systems in parameter space and claim that regions devoid of short period microgeometry can represent quasiperiodic materials.<p>
   <p> It turned out that periodic microgeometry is dense in the scale factor (horizontal) and twist angle(vertical) parameter plane. In this video, each dot represents parameter values leading to periodic microgeometry. The bigger the dot, the shorter the period. As we zoom in on smaller and smaller regions of parameter space, dot size re-scales and longer period systems fade in as single pixels. Dot color helps us follow individual dots with our eye, but the actual colors are not significant.<p>
